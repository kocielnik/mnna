# Towards a PhD from a world-class university

I see this, first of all, as an opportunity to play with the system in a bit non-standard manner. I noticed that I can accelerate my previous schedule for reaching a PhD by enrolling on a remote PhD programme.

## Typical resource requirements

> Part-time students usually take six to eight years to complete their program while the minimum amount of time one has to spend in the program is four years. Like many European programs, there are no required courses but rather a thesis and an oral examination called a viva voce. The viva voce consists of a thesis defense as well as an oral examination of the candidate's subject of inquiry.

> Australian National University is typically offers on-campus, residential degrees but does make exceptions for distance learners. If an exemption for distance learning is granted, then the student is required to be in residence, not consecutively, for four weeks of the academic year.
